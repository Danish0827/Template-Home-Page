            <strong>Cotton Culture</strong> is a fashion brand based in India
            that specializes in women’s ethnic wear. The brand is known for its
            contemporary and stylish designs that blend traditional Indian
            textiles with modern fashion sensibilities. Here’s a detailed
            overview of Cotton Culture:
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            In the year 2000, we started with a manufacturing unit to design and
            manufacture ladies' garments for sale to large retail stores. After
            almost one decade of experience in selling to large retail houses,
            we decided to venture into retailing in our own brand name of{" "}
            <strong>Cotton Culture</strong>, which was born in 2010 with only
            two self-managed stores.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The last few years have seen exponential growth, and today we have
            43 self-managed stores across India. This number is climbing every
            year. The time is now ripe for us to take our range of exclusive
            women's clothing online and make them available to every woman
            across the globe.
